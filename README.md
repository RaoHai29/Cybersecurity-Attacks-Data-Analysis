**Cybersecurity Attacks Data Analysis**
This project involves analyzing a comprehensive dataset of cybersecurity attacks to derive actionable insights. The dataset consists of 25 varied metrics across 40,000 records, capturing detailed information about each attack. The following sections outline the dataset's structure, the steps taken in the analysis, and the insights gained.

Dataset Overview
The dataset includes the following columns:

Timestamp: The date and time when the attack was recorded.
Source IP Address: The IP address from which the attack originated.
Destination IP Address: The IP address targeted by the attack.
Source Port: The port number used by the source IP address.
Destination Port: The port number targeted on the destination IP address.
Protocol: The protocol used in the attack (e.g., TCP, UDP).
Packet Length: The length of the data packets involved in the attack.
Packet Type: The type of packet involved.
Traffic Type: The type of network traffic associated with the attack.
Payload Data: The data carried by the packets.
Malware Indicators: Indicators suggesting the presence of malware.
Anomaly Scores: Scores indicating the severity of detected anomalies.
Alerts/Warnings: Alerts or warnings triggered by the attack.
Attack Type: The type of attack performed.
Attack Signature: Signature identifying the attack.
Action Taken: The response or action taken in response to the attack.
Severity Level: The severity level of the attack.
User Information: Information about the user affected by the attack.
Device Information: Information about the device targeted or involved.
Network Segment: The network segment where the attack occurred.
Geo-location Data: Geographical location related to the attack.
Proxy Information: Information about any proxies involved.
Firewall Logs: Logs from firewall activity.
IDS/IPS Alerts: Alerts from Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) or Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS).
Log Source: The source from which the logs originated.

**Insights**
1. Most Frequent Attack Types
Identifies and visualizes the top five most frequent attack types, highlighting the most common threats in the dataset.

2. Correlation Between Packet Length and Severity Level
Calculates and reports the correlation between packet length and severity level to understand if larger packets are associated with more severe attacks.

3. Most Common Geo-Locations for Attacks
Determines and visualizes the top geo-locations where attacks are most frequently reported, revealing geographical patterns of attack occurrences.

4. Action Taken for Different Attack Types
Reviews and visualizes the actions taken in response to different attack types, providing insights into response measures.

5. Anomaly Scores Distribution by Malware Indicators
Explores the distribution of anomaly scores based on malware indicators, assessing the severity of anomalies detected in the dataset.

**Tools and Libraries**
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For creating visualizations.
Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
